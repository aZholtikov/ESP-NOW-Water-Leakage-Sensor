1. Model WIFI S2 Type 1. Built on Tuya WiFi module TYWE3S (ESP8266 chip). Analogue of ESP-01. Does not require replacement. Total triggering time about 2 sec (NORMAL), 0.4 sec (LITE). [Photo](https://github.com/aZholtikov/ESP-NOW-Water-Leakage-Sensor/tree/main/hardware/Model_WIFI_S2_Type_1).

2. Model WIFI S2 Type 2. Built on Tuya WiFi module CB3S (BK7231N chip). Replacement required. Performed replacement with ESP-12E. Total triggering time about 1.5 sec (NORMAL), 0.3 sec (LITE).

A pull-up to GND of GPIO15 is required (i used a 0805 10K SMD resistor on top of the module pins).
